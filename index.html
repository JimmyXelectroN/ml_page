			<p>In this article I would like to highlight the field of Machine Learning as it is today. This article is aimed at the lay persons and experts alike. I start by explaining the field. I then go on to highlight the possible uses of this technology. The article then takes a darker turn as I explain to seemingly opposing problems: The fear of winter and the fear of exponential growth in the field. These two fears will either happen sequentially or only one will occur. But, both are concerning.</p>

		<h2 id="section_one">What is Machine Learning?</h2>
		<p>Machine Learning is essentially the fitting of models to data. These models can either by linear equations, logistic functions, support vector machines, decision trees or the more popular neural networks. As long as we have a model that can change itself to adapt to data, we have machine learning. Even something as trivia as a child's play-doh can be considered a learning model. The surface and shape of the play-doh adapts to the forces applied on it. Thats why its called modeling clay. Because it can model a situation, given some data. The only difference between modeling clay and a deep neural network is the way in which they function and model their data. So specifically machine learning, is the fitting of data to learning models, that are made out of computer hardware or software.</p>
